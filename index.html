      <p><span>CSS</span> is a language used to style and layout web pages. It allows you to control the appearance of HTML elements, such as their color, font, size, and position.</p>


      <p><span>Basic Syntax</span></p>
<p>To apply CSS styles to an HTML document, you can use the <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag or an external stylesheet. The basic syntax of a CSS rule looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>For example, to change the color of all <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span> elements to red, you could use the following CSS rule:</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
       h1 {
          color: red;
       }
        </code>
      </pre>
